For building and testing, be in ConEmu, cmd, or powershell, not bash!
As administrator!

To build: cpack
To test:  cinst -fd [package].nuspec

Use checksums!  This looks like:

      Install-ChocolateyPackage 'anki' 'exe' '/S' 'https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.0.38.exe' -Checksum '51F4A62AA97EF2DB57037CC51A36E6D04CB53D1F0BF74119E325F6C34608A5BF' -ChecksumType 'sha256'

You can gather them by doing:

      $ checksum -t sha256 -f ~/Downloads/anki-2.0.38.exe
      51F4A62AA97EF2DB57037CC51A36E6D04CB53D1F0BF74119E325F6C34608A5BF

From the auto-validator, some things to keep in mind:

##### Guidelines
Guidelines are strong suggestions that improve the quality of a package version. These are considered something to fix for next time to increase the quality of the package. O
ver time Guidelines can become Requirements. A package version can be approved without addressing Guideline comments but will reduce the quality of the package.

* The nuspec has been enhanced to allow `packageSourceUrl`, pointing to the url where the package source resides. This is a strong guideline because it simplifies collaborati
on. Please add it to the nuspec. [More...](https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator/wiki/PackageSourceUrlMissing)
* Release Notes (releaseNotes) are a short description of changes in each version of a package. Please include releasenotes in the nuspec. **NOTE:** To prevent the need to co
ntinually update this field, providing a URL to an external list of Release Notes is perfectly acceptable. [More...](https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator/wiki/Rele
aseNotesNotEmpty)
* This package uses a helper function that requires administrative permissions, the tag 'admin' should also be in the nuspec. [More...](https://github.com/chocolatey/package-
validator/wiki/AdminTagShouldBeUsedWhenUsingAdminHelper)
  * **NOTE:** This becomes a Requirement starting on 1 February 2016.
* Title (title) matches id exactly. Please consider using something slightly more descriptive for the title in the nuspec. [More...](https://github.com/chocolatey/package-val
idator/wiki/TitleNotSameAsPackageId)
* There are more than 3 installation scripts in this package. This is not recommended as it increases the complexity of the package. [More...](https://github.com/chocolatey/p
ackage-validator/wiki/MoreThanMaximumAutomationScripts)

##### Suggestions
Suggestions are either newly introduced items that will later become Guidelines or items that are don't carry enough weight to become a Guideline. Either way they should be c
onsidered. A package version can be approved without addressing Suggestion comments.

* The nuspec has been enhanced to allow more information related to the software. [More...](https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator/wiki/NuspecEnhancementsMissing) Pl
ease consider adding one or more of the following to the nuspec, if available:
  * docsUrl - points to the location of the wiki or docs of the software
  * mailingListUrl - points to the forum or email list group for the software
  * bugTrackerUrl - points to the location where issues and tickets can be accessed
  * projectSourceUrl - points to the location of the underlying software source


OLD to test: cinst [packageName] -fdv -s "%cd%"
            If that fails, try adding "--version [new version]"
